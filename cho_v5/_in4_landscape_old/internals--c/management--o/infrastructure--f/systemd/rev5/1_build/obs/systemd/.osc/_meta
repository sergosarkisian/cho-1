  <title>A System and Session Manager</title>
  <description>Systemd is a system and service manager, compatible with SysV and LSB
init scripts for Linux. systemd provides aggressive parallelization
capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,
offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state,
maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate
transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can work as a
drop-in replacement for sysvinit.</description>
